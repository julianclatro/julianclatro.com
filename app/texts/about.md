I'm a full stack web developer with more than 14 years of experience working on web projects from Wordpress to Ruby on Rails and NodeJs applications. I also have valuable experience as a product and graphic designer.

I offer solutions for projects looking for web development of sites, apis and apps. From traditional approaches, setting up a server from the ground using linux distributions to services running on the edge using Cloudflare workers and Deno.

I build robust design systems from Figma to Storybook with the help of React and Tailwind.

I authored several libraries written in ruby and typescript for private and public projects.

When building I always follow SOLID, TDD and design patterns in my architecture. I believe databases doesn’t  need ORMs, they can create more bottlenecks when the project scales.
